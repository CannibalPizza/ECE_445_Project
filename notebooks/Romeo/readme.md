## 2/11/2025 - First Meeting With TA
This day included our first meeting with our TA, Chi Zhang. Prior to the meeting, our group began working thoroughly on the project proposal. This included copying over the template for the proposal, and then writing our ideas down.

By the end of our first meeting before talking to the TA, we wrote down the majority of the problem and solution statements, some visual aids about how we wanted our system to work on an actual door, and then bulleted lists briefly touching on system overview and requirements. We also discussed what clarifying questions to ask the TA.

During the TA meeting we explained our project. We want a box mounted on the door frame to contain an ESP32, which would control a motor that would be able to  swing the door open and closed. This would be controlled by a remote that the user can pair to that ESP32 with another ESP32 in the remote. The user would be able to connect to multiple of these door systems, so that they can open/close whatever doors in their house they please. Each door system would also include a battery-powered door handle. This handle would replace the old handle and would contain another ESP32 that can communicate with the door. With this the door would be able to open without the latch preventing the opening. The TA suggested making more quantitative requirements, such as door weight requirements and timing with signals and opening. We were also told to email the professor about how we would go about demoing the door, since we would find it difficult demoing on an actual door.

## 2/13/2025 - Proposal Completion and Machine Workshop
We met with the Machine Workshop early in the afternoon to discuss the work that can be done for our project. This was due to us emailing the professor asking about how to go about demoing our project. Within the email we clarified the project idea, since there was plenty of confusion about our intentions. The professor suggested that we demo on a model door.

The Machine Shop already had a model door that was about 5 lbs and dimensions of21 x 13 inches. We also determined that the Machine Shop can provide us with the boxes that contain the circuitry for all subsystems (door opener, latch, and remote). They will also be able to attach the boxes and motors onto the door that need to be attached.

We changed the project to be based around what we will demo by the end of the semester. This means that we won't have an internal system for the handle anymore, and instead we will have a box with an actuating latch attached on the frame of the door. This way we can still emulate what the door handle was supposed to dowith the original idea. We also determined that since we will only have one door, then we can create another system not attached to any door just to demonstrate that the remote can attached to multiple systems if needed. These changes were shown in the visual aids and block diagrams created by my partners. I focused on clarifying the problem and solution statements in the project proposal. We also talked about timings and worked that the signals should be transferred between the 3 subsystems in a quarter of second. We also determined that the door should open in about 3 seconds, which we did tolerance analysis to determine the motor needed. We determined the parts we needed after figuring our the voltages that multiple necessary parts needed (motor, solenoid latch, ESP32, etc.) and finished the project proposal.

## 2/19/2025 - Proposal Review
We presented our proposal to the TA and professor. The project was approved due to the complexity and scope of the project. However, we missed out on including some circuitry in our subsystems overviews and block diagrams. This demonstrated that we needed to do more research about how the signals were to be send and received. We did not know what needed to drive the motor. The proofessor suggested considering at an H-bridge to start for driving the motor. He also said to that we can use an LDO to step-down the voltage inside of the remote from 3.6V to 3.3V, since the change in voltage is quite small.

## 2/24/2025 - Motor Driver Discussion
I was not present for the meeting between my partners, but they researched into the H-bridge. They informed me afterwards how we can use the ports from the ESP32 and we can control the direction and speed of the motor using the H-bridge. We also discussed about when we can start meeting more frequently in order to make significant progress in the project, since we got ahead on other work. Lastly, we talked about other research that we can perfrom about circuitry that should have been included in the block diagram. This included additional research into the circuitry that will have to be performed within the remote for displaying the door numbers and LEDs.
