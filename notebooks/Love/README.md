## 02/11/2025 - First Meeting with TA
---
This was our first meeting with out TA, Chi Zhang. We were discussing our project proposal and a few notes from the meeting included the following:
1. Highlevel requirements should be quantifiable
2. We needed to discuss with the professor about how we should demo our project
3. Better the block diagram such that each block has specific component names and the connects are properly labeled
4. Most of the proposal should mention measurable stuff much as the delay or response time of the systems

With this information, my group and I discussed these aspects and prepared the project proposal for the final submission. 

## 02/13/2025 - Talk with Machine Shop
---
After emailing the professor regarding our demonstration for the final demo, we talked with the Machine Shop to see if they had a door that was scaled down for demonstration purposes. They provided us with a door that will fit well for our project demonstration. We also discussed aspects of which motor to use to help with the Door Opener System and we were suggested a 12V DC gear motor. With this information, my group and I updated our proposal to reflect our scaled down door and determined parts based on that. 

## 02/19/2025 - Proposal Review with Professor
---
We presented our final proposal in front of the Professor Gruev. In terms of complexity, the professor approved the project but the group was unaware of how we were doing to drive the 12V DC gear motor. Professor Gruev told us to focus on that aspect of the project to ensure we understand what is going on. He also suggested that instead of using a voltage regulator to step down certain voltages, we should look into LDO.
